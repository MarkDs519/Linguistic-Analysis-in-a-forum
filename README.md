# Linguistic-Analysis-in-a-forum
A statistical analysis investigating whether members who are communicating directly with each other use similar language. In short, whether members in a certain thread communicate via the same language. Furthermore investigation was done to find whether this language change in time.

The Report.pdf gives a detailed explanation of how the analysis was performed. Statistical concepts such as mean, standard deviation and variance were used to make a solid conclusion on whether members who are communicating directly with each other use similar language. Furthermore, a time series analysis was required to analyze the change in the language.
